[ ] assume a role with sts for the iam client
[ ] use a flag to control whether it will delete roles when SA is deleted


questions:
1) Should we add a labels or annotations to track if this should be managed by the controller?
currently this is done just by checking it has the right eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn annotation
2) Should events be added to the ServiceAccount resource to say it was synced?
